I‚Äôm Chad‚Äîa front-end developer based in South Africa. I love building, I love software engineering, I love design, I love the web.

![Me](/images/content/about/me/1.png)

I currently work at [forgood](https://www.forgood.co.za), an online volunteering platform that connects people to charities and causes. My day-to-day stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and VanillaJS.

Like most developers, I‚Äôve spent a ridiculous amount of time scouring dev blogs‚Äînot for fun (except when I‚Äôm checking out something cool, like a macOS remake or [Bruno Simon‚Äôs 3D portfolio](https://bruno-simon.com/)). Usually, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm stuck on a problem, and I just need a **straight-up solution**.

## And that‚Äôs what this blog is about

Ever found yourself deep in a debugging session, bouncing between Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and some random forum post from 2013, only to realize none of them give you **exactly** what you need? Yeah, same.

I hate sifting through unnecessary fluff when I just want **a clear, step-by-step guide** to the answer. No assumptions, no missing steps‚Äîjust the solution, **plus a working demo** where possible. That's what I'm trying to achieve here:

- **Concise, problem-solving posts** based on real issues I‚Äôve run into.
- **Minimal distractions**, just well-structured, readable content.
- **Code examples that actually work**, without the ‚Äúfigure the rest out yourself‚Äù nonsense.

## The tech stack _(in case you're curious)_

### **Next.js 15 App Router**

Generated as a static site‚Äîbecause, honestly, static was all I needed. I originally planned to go with plain HTML, CSS, and JS, and I _100%_ would have, but most of the components I use (and want to show demos of) are in React.

### **Posts are rendered statically at build time**

Here‚Äôs the Next.js config file. It includes static export, MDX, and PWA setup:

```javascript
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
import withPWA from "next-pwa";

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "mdx"],
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  transpilePackages: ["next-mdx-remote"],
};

const withPWAConfig = withPWA({
  dest: "public",
});

const withMDX = createMDX({
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY,
  },
});

export default withPWAConfig(withMDX(nextConfig));
```

Technically, this blog didn‚Äôt _need_ to be a PWA, but I have [a guide](/post/setting-up-a-pwa-in-nextjs) on setting one up and figured I‚Äôd demo the install button while I was at it.

### **Hosted on GitHub Pages ([Repo here](https://github.com/cdnkr/cdnkr.blog))**

GitHub Pages works great‚Äîhonestly had it up and running in no time. I considered [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), but their firewall blocks Google‚Äôs search indexing crawlers unless you pay per request to whitelist their IPs. With GitHub Pages? None of that. Super easy custom domain setup. GitHub Actions work like a dream. No server, no edge functions‚Äîbut that‚Äôs fine. I come from the pre-Next.js era, where everything was client-side anyway. This feels like home.

### **JavaScript > TypeScript**

I love TypeScript for large-scale apps‚Äîit‚Äôs safe and whatever else. But, for a _"weekend"_ project like this, the developer experience plain JS offers, for me at least, is just so quick and efficient. And most importantly, no type gymnastics (my least favorite sport).

### **MDX for content**

This allows me to embed interactive demos directly inside posts. I used [`mdx-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-mdx-remote/v/0.5.1)‚Äîonly to later discover that Next.js has built-in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support. At that point, it was too late (or I was too lazy) to switch. Whatever‚Ä¶ it works.

### **Code blocks styled with `rehype-code-prettier`**

Under the hood, it uses **Shiki** for syntax highlighting.

The copy code button was a bit more of a pain than expected because of how [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) structures the output‚Äîwrapping each line/token in spans inside a `<code>` block, inside a `<pre>` tag. I had to extract the text from the `<pre>` element‚Äôs children and add it to `navigator.clipboard`. There's probably a far better way to do this, but eventually, I got it working.

```javascript
const components = {
  pre: ({ children }) => {
    const getTextContent = (node) => {
      if (typeof node === "string") return node;
      if (!node) return "";
      if (Array.isArray(node)) return node.map(getTextContent).join("");
      if (node.props?.children) return getTextContent(node.props.children);
      return "";
    };

    const text = getTextContent(children);

    return (
      <div className="lg:p-4 lg:border-2 lg:border-dashed lg:border-dark my-8">
        <div className="relative">
          <CopyButton text={text} className="absolute right-2 top-2" />
          <pre className="group p-4 overflow-x-auto text-white bg-dark">
            {children}
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  },
  // ...other components
};
```

### **Design by me**

Well kind of, I literally just tweaked Tailwind classes until I was happy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That said, I _do_ appreciate good design. I can spend hours scrolling through [Godly‚Äôs](https://godly.website/) insane collection of featured sites, just taking in all the creativity.

My taste leans toward **simple, minimalistic** designs that stand out in unexpected ways‚Äîa blend of technical execution and pure design concepts.

For this site, I probably spent more time tweaking the design than actually coding. This is like the _fifth_ version, and honestly? I‚Äôm still not completely happy with it. üòÖ But design is a skill I‚Äôm actively working on, and since I don‚Äôt usually get the chance to flex that muscle, it‚Äôs been dope designing something entirely for myself.

### **And that‚Äôs it...**

If it helps just one other dev, I‚Äôll be happy. And if it doesn‚Äôt? Whatever. The most important thing is that this has been an absolute blast to build.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for being here.

**Peace.**
