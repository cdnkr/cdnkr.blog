I've been experimenting with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, and I have to say—it's seriously impressive. It’s blazing fast, cost-effective, and comes with massive context windows. So, I put together a quick tutorial on how to use it in a simple chatbot. I also dive into tokenization to swap out response IDs with preview cards, which looks pretty damn cool.

<Block className="not-prose text-tertiary mt-6" variant="dark" caretPosition="top-left">
    <h3 className="text-xl uppercase font-bold">Please note</h3>
    <p>This is not the recommended implementation, as it exposes environment keys client side.<br />While this tutorial details how to restrict your API key to only your site, the Next.js implementation is favored as API keys are never exposed to the client. See <a href="/post/ai-chatbot-component-with-product-preview-cards-in-next-with-gemini-2-flash" className="uppercase underline font-bold">this example</a> for the full Next.js approach.</p>

### Here's what we'll build:

<Chatbot />

**Note: The above is only a demo to prevent misuse _(and having a massive Google API bill)_.**

---

**A Quick Note About Gemini:** At the time of writing, Gemini (especially new releases like Flash 2.0) can be under heavy load. You might experience occasional errors or slowdowns. Don't be discouraged – this is expected with new and popular AI models!

---

### Why Gemini 2.0 Flash?

Gemini 2.0 Flash is a powerful and efficient language model that's perfect for chatbot applications. It's designed for speed and responsiveness, making it ideal for real-time conversations. Not to mention that it's far cheaper than other available models. Check out this [Output speed vs. Price comparison](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models#:~:text=Output%20Speed%20vs.%20Price).

---

### Project Setup

This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of React and have a development environment set up (Node.js, npm or yarn).

---

### Getting Your Gemini API Key

1.  Go to: [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2.  Click on "Get API Key" in the top left corner.
3.  Follow the prompts to create a new project and generate an API key.

### Important Security Measure

Since we're going with a client side React.js implementation it's crucial to restrict allowed URL's on your key. Follow these steps to set the allowed URL's:

1.  Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2.  Navigate to "Credentials."
3.  Click on your "Generative Language API Key."
4.  Under "Application restrictions," add your website URL and the path where the chatbot will be used. For example, for this article, you would add: `cdnkr.blog/*`
5. Save changes.

### The Code: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's dive into the code for our `Chatbot` component. We'll break down each part to understand how it works.

---

#### 1. Sample data

The below is some sample data we'll be using in this demo. For a real world implementation we'd use results from an API.

*   `SAMPLE_FAQ`: An array of objects representing frequently asked questions and their answers. This data will be used to inform the chatbot's responses.
*   `SAMPLE_PRODUCTS`: An array of objects representing the products in our online shoe store. This data will be used to provide details about specific shoes.
*   `INITIAL_MESSAGES`: An array containing the initial welcome message from the chatbot.

Later we'll import and use this data.

```javascript
// /data.js
// Sample FAQ data for our demo shoe store
const SAMPLE_FAQ = [
    {
        question: "What is your return policy?",
        answer: "We offer a 30-day return policy on unworn shoes in their original packaging.  See our full Return & Exchange policy for details and exclusions.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I find my correct shoe size?",
        answer: "We have a comprehensive size guide available on our website. You can find it [link to size guide]. We recommend measuring your foot in socks at the end of the day for the most accurate measurement.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer free shipping?",
        answer: "Yes! We offer free standard shipping on all orders over $75 within the continental United States.  Expedited shipping options are available for an additional fee.",
    },
    {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), PayPal, and Apple Pay.",
    },
    {
        question: "How do I care for my leather shoes?",
        answer: "For leather shoes, we recommend using a leather cleaner and conditioner regularly.  Avoid getting them excessively wet.  For suede, use a suede brush and protector spray.",
    },
    {
        question: "Are your shoes ethically sourced?",
        answer: "We are committed to ethical sourcing and work closely with our manufacturers to ensure fair labor practices and environmentally responsible production.  We are continuously working to improve our sustainability efforts.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long will it take to receive my order?",
        answer: "Standard shipping typically takes 3-7 business days within the continental US.  Expedited shipping options are available for faster delivery.",
    },
    {
        question: "Do you ship internationally?",
        answer: "Yes, we ship to select countries internationally. Shipping costs and delivery times vary depending on the destination. Please see our shipping policy for more details.",
    },

// A welcome message for the chatbot

        role: "assistant",
        content: "Hey there👋 I'm here to help you find the perfect shoe for your needs. What are you looking for?"
    }
];

```

#### 2. `CardPreview` Component
This component is responsible for rendering a preview card for a specific shoe product. It takes a `productId` as a prop, finds the corresponding product in the `SAMPLE_PRODUCTS` array, and displays its image, name, category, price, and a short description.

```javascript
// /components/CardPreview.jsx
function CardPreview({ productId }) {
    const product = SAMPLE_PRODUCTS.find(p => p.id === productId);
    if (!product) return null;

    return (
        <div className="border-2 cursor-pointer bg-white p-4 mt-2 mb-4 flex gap-4 max-w-[400px] shadow-[6px_6px_0_0_#000] active:shadow-[1px_1px_0_0_#000] hover:shadow-[8px_8px_0_0_#000] transition-all duration-300">
            <img
                src={product.imageUrl}
                alt={product.name}
                className="w-24 h-24 object-cover"
            />
            <div className="flex-1">
                <h3 className="font-bold">{product.name}</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{product.category}</p>
                <p className="font-semibold">${product.price.toFixed(2)}</p>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">
                    {product.description.slice(0, 100)}
                    {product.description.length > 100 ? "..." : ""}
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

---

#### 3. `MessageContent` Component

This component is responsible for rendering the content of a chat message. It's designed to detect product IDs embedded in the chatbot's response (in the format `%shoeId%`) and replace them with the `CardPreview` component.  This allows the chatbot to display interactive product cards within the conversation.

```javascript
// /components/MessageContent.jsx
function MessageContent({ content }) {
    // Split content by product ID pattern
    const parts = content.split(/(%[\d]+%)/);

    return (
        <>
            {parts.map((part, index) => {
                // Check if this part matches the product ID pattern
                const match = part.match(/^%([\d]+)%$/);
                if (match) {
                    // If it's a product ID, render the CardPreview
                    return <CardPreview key={index} productId={match[1]} />;
                }
                // Otherwise render the text
                return <span key={index}>{part}</span>;
            })}
        </>
    );
}
```

---

#### 4. `Chatbot` Component (Main Component)

This is the main component that orchestrates the chatbot functionality.

*   **State Management:**
    *   `messages`: An array of objects representing the chat messages. Each message has a `role` (either "user" or "assistant") and `content`.
    *   `input`: The text currently entered in the input field.
    *   `isLoading`: A boolean indicating whether the chatbot is currently processing a request.
*   **Refs:**
    *   `messagesContainerRef`: A ref used to scroll the chat container to the bottom when new messages are added.
    *   **`useEffect` Hook:** This hook is used to automatically scroll the chat container to the bottom whenever the `messages` state changes.
    *   **`sendMessage` Function:** This is the core function that sends the user's message to the Gemini API and handles the response.

```javascript
// /components/Chatbot.jsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { INITIAL_MESSAGES, SAMPLE_PRODUCTS, SAMPLE_FAQ } from "../data";

export default function Chatbot() {
    // State for managing chat messages, user input, and loading state
    const [messages, setMessages] = useState(INITIAL_MESSAGES);
    const [input, setInput] = useState("");
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    // Ref for auto-scrolling to the latest message
    const messagesContainerRef = useRef(null);

    /**
     * Scrolls the messages container to the bottom
     */
    const scrollToBottom = () => {
        if (messagesContainerRef.current) {
            messagesContainerRef.current.scroll({
                top: messagesContainerRef.current.scrollHeight,
                behavior: 'smooth'
            });
        }
    };
    

    // Auto-scroll when new messages are added
    useEffect(() => {
        scrollToBottom();
    }, [messages]);

    /**
     * Sends a message to the Gemini API and handles the response streaming
     * @param {string} userInput - The message text from the user
     */
    async function sendMessage(userInput) {
        // Don't process empty messages
        if (!userInput.trim()) return;

        // Add user's message to the chat
        setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: "user", content: userInput }]);
        setInput(""); // Clear input field
        setIsLoading(true); // Show loading state

        try {
            // Set up Gemini API request
            const GEMINI_API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY;
            const url = `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}`;

            // Construct the system prompt with product catalog and FAQ data
            const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant for an online shoe store. Use the following product catalog and FAQ information to assist customers:

Product Catalog:
${JSON.stringify(SAMPLE_PRODUCTS, null, 2)}

FAQ Information:
${JSON.stringify(SAMPLE_FAQ, null, 2)}

Important: When referring to specific shoes, include the shoe ID in the format %shoeId%. For example, if discussing the Nike Air Max 90, include %1003% in your response.

Please provide helpful, friendly responses about our shoes, sizing, shipping, returns, and any other customer inquiries. If a customer asks about specific shoes, make sure to reference them using the ID format mentioned above.`;

            // Combine system prompt with user's message
            const fullPrompt = `${systemPrompt}\n\nCustomer: ${userInput}\nAssistant:`;

            // Make API request to Gemini
            const response = await fetch(url, {
                method: "POST",
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",

                    }]
                })
            });

            if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Network response was not ok");

            // Parse the response
            const data = await response.json();
            const text = data?.candidates?.[0]?.content?.parts?.[0]?.text;

            if (!text) {
                throw new Error("No response from Gemini");
            }

            // Store the index where we'll insert the assistant's message
            // This prevents issues with state updates during streaming
            const messageIndex = messages.length;
            setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: "assistant", content: "" }]);

            // Simulate streaming by splitting response into words
            const chunks = text.split(" ");
            let currentContent = "";

            // Add each word with a delay to create a typing effect
            for (let i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
                currentContent += chunks[i] + " ";
                setMessages(prev => {

                    newMessages[messageIndex + 1] = {

                        content: currentContent 
                    };
                    return newMessages;
                });
                // Add a small delay between words
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
            }

        } catch (error) {
            // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
            console.error("Error:", error);
            setMessages(prev => [...prev, {

##### Inside `sendMessage`:

1.  **Input Validation:** Checks if the user input is empty.
2.  **Update Chat State:** Adds the user's message to the `messages` array and clears the input field.
3.  **API Request:**
    *   Sets the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the API endpoint URL.
    *   Uses `fetch` to make a POST request directly to the Gemini API.  The request includes the user's message.
4.  **Handle API Response:**
    *   Parses the JSON response from the API.
    *   Simulates streaming by splitting the response text into words and updating the message content with a small delay between words to create a "typing" effect.
5.  **Error Handling:** Catches any errors that occur during the API call and displays an error message to the user.
6.  **Loading State:**  Sets the `isLoading` state to `true` before the API call and `false` after, regardless of whether the call succeeds or fails.

#### 5.  Rendering the Chat Interface

The `return` statement in the `Chatbot` component renders the chat interface.  It includes:

*   A container for the chat messages.
*   A loop that iterates over the `messages` array and displays each message.
*   An input field for the user to type their messages.
*   A "Send" button that triggers the `sendMessage` function.
